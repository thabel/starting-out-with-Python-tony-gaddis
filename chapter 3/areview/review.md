1. *fasle*
2. *false*
3. *fasle*
4. *true*
5. *true*

[-----------------Short-Answer--------------]
1. conditionally executed : it means code test before exceute
if the test is true , the execution occurs else , the code under
the condition is skipped.

2. A single alternative decision offers only one path of execucution; if the condition
is true execute the code under that condition.if not continue with rest 
of the statement.

But a dual alternative decision offers two paths of exceution.it uses the 
if-esle statement.

3. the and operator : the value is true if both operands are true.
4. the or operator ;: the value is true if either one of the operands 
in true.
5. the or operator.
6. a flag is a boolean varial that signals if a certain condition is met 
in the program
