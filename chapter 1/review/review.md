1) A programm is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
2)The physical devices that a computer is made of are referred to as hardware.
3) The part of a computer that runs programs is called the CPU
4)Today, CPUs are small chips known as microprocesseurs
5)The computer stores a program while the program is running, as well as the data that 
the program is working with, in main memory
6)This is a volatile type of memory that is used only for temporary storage while a pro0gram is running : the RAM(Random Acess Memory)
7)A type of memory that can hold data for long periods of time, even when there is no 
power to the computer, is called the secondary memory ( an example is the disk drive)
8)A component that collects data from people or other devices and sends it to the computer is called an input device.
9). A video display is a(n) output device.
10) A byte is enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number.
11)A byte is made up of eight bits.
12)In the binary numbering system, all numeric values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s.
13)A bit that is turned off represents the following value: 0.
14)A set of 128 numeric codes that represent the English letters, various punctuation 
marks, and other characters is ASCII.
15)An extensive encoding scheme that can represent characters for many languages in the 
world is Unicode.
16)Negative numbers are encoded using the two's complement  technique.
17)Real numbers are encoded using the floating technique.
18)The tiny dots of color that digital images are composed of are called pixels
19)If you were to look at a machine language program, you would see  a stream of binary numbers.
20)In the  part of the fetch-decode-execute cycle, the CPU determines which 
operation it should perform.
21)Computers can only execute programs that are written in machine language.
22)The assembler translates an assembly language program to a machine language 
program
23)The words that make up a high-level programming language are called key-word.
24)The rules that must be followed when writing a program are called syntax.
25)A compiler program translates a high-level language program into a separate 
machine language program.


True or False:

1. Today, CPUs are huge devices made of electrical and mechanical components such as 
vacuum tubes and switches.: False.

2. Main memory is also known as RAM : True

3. Any piece of data that is stored in a computer’s memory must be stored as a binary 
number.: True

4. Images, like the ones created with your digital camera, cannot be stored as binary 
numbers: False

5. Machine language is the only language that a CPU understands.: True

6. Assembly language is considered a high-level language.: False

7. An interpreter is a program that both translates and executes the instructions in a highlevel language programm : True

8. A syntax error does not prevent a program from being compiled and executed.:
False

9. Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and macOS are all examples of application software:
False

10. Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, email programs, web browsers, 
and games are all examples of utility programs.: False

Short answer:
1. How does the main memory and the secondary storage of a computer differ from each 
other?

the secondary storage store data for a long period , even if the computer is turned off.
But the main memory(RAM) store data for a moment( when the program is running), Alse the 
memmory is cleared ,when the computer is turn off

2. What number does a bit that is turned on represent? What number does a bit that is 
turned off represent?

What number does a bit that is turned on represent : 1;
What number does a bit that is turned off represent : 0;

3. How many different characters can be represented in ASCII? Name the character set 
that addresses this limitation.

 How many different characters can be represented in ASCII? : 128 ;
 Name the character set that addresses this limitation. : Unicode:

4. What is an individual instruction in a program written in a high-level programming 
language called? : statements;

5. What are the short words that are used in assembly language called? : mnemonic

6. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
A compiler translate the source code(written in high level ) into a separate 
machine code, that can be run after ( anytime).

But the interpreter both translate and run each intructions in the source.

What type of software controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware?: operating systems

Exerices:
1) convert to binary
14 = (1110)
87 = (0101 0111)
128 = (1000 0000)
254 = (1111 1110)

2)Converts to decimal
101 == 5
1111 == 15
11 0010 == (3*16 + 2) = 50

code(space) == 58
code(A) == 65
code(a) == 97

Who was the creator of Python?: Guido Van Rossum
And what does his title of “BDFL” mean?: Benevolent Dictator For Life
What is “The Zen of Python”?: is a collection of 19 "guiding principles"
for writing computer programs that influenec the design of the python programming
language.

In which year was the first version of Python 3 released : 2008, and in which year was the 
final version of Python 2 released?:2000.
