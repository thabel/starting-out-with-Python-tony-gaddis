In order for a program to work with a file on the computerâ€™s disk, the program must create 
a file object in memory. A file object is an object that is associated with a specific file and 
provides a way for the program to work with that file. In the program, a variable references 
the file object. This variable is used to carry out any operations that are performed on the 
file
