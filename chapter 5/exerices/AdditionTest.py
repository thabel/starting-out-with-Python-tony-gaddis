"""
Write a program that generates printable addition tests. The tests should consist of 5 ques
tions which present a simple addition question in the following format, where the question
number goes from 1 to 5, and num1 and num2 are randomly generated numbers between
1 and 10:
 Question 1
 num1 + num2 = _____
The program should simply display the 5 questions â€“ it should not prompt the user for any
input
