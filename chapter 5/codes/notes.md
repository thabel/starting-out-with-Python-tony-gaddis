# What a funtion is Good
A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the 
purpose of performing a specific task
# Benefit of using functions
* Simpler Code
* Code Reuse (reduce duplication of code)
* Better Testing
* Faster Development(unctions can be written for the commonly 
needed tasks, and those functions can be incorporated into 
each program that needs them.)
* Easier Facilitation of Teamwork

# Void Functions

When you call a void function, it simply executes the statements it 
contains and then terminates

The code for a function is known as a function definition. To execute 
the function, you write a statement that calls it.

# Defining and Calling a Function

def function_name():
    statement
    statement
    etc.

# definition

def students():
    print("name","thabel")
    print("name", "Malawi")

# calling
* students()

# Main function

It is often said that the main function contains a program’s mainline logic, which 
is the overall logic of the program.

# notes ->

When a program calls a function, programmers commonly say that the 
control of the program transfers to that function. This simply means that the function 
takes control of the program’s execution.

# Local variables 

A local variable is created inside a function and cannot be accessed by 
statements that are outside the function. Different functions can have 
local variables with the same names because the functions cannot see 
each other's local variables.

# arguments
An argument is any piece of data that is passed into a function when the 
function is called. A parameter is a variable that receives an argument 
that is passed into a function.

# Global variables and Global constant
A global variable is accessible to all the functions in a program file

# Concept of Module
A module is a file that contains Python code. Large programs are easier 
to debug and maintain when they are divided into modules.
